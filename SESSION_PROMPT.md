# Session 476 Prompt: Review DOCX Templates — Schema-First Release

## Current Outcome

The owner approved the recommended review-DOCX design. The complete implementation
is Production-live on `main` at `3101f067` in Ready deployment
`dpl_AjT5FeDh5wkdeFSoZWJsVDM5oBqs`.

- [VERIFIED via source, focused tests, and signed-in Production export] The Review Manager's existing combined
  Word export now calls a guarded server route, rereads the proposal and submitted
  reviews from Dataverse, and renders the approved combined template. The browser
  supplies only a validated proposal GUID.
- [VERIFIED via deployed source, focused tests, and rendered-page inspection] The thank-you sweep renders
  the submitted review through the approved individual template and attaches it
  when generation succeeds. Per-review render failure remains nonfatal to the
  thank-you send and is reported separately.
- [VERIFIED via Production apply and independent metadata readback 2026-09-03]
  Wave 25 created `wmkf_appreviewanswer.wmkf_questionoptions` as the exact
  nullable Memo field declared by the schema, with `MaxLength=20000`.
- [VERIFIED via source] New categorical answer rows snapshot the complete ordered
  `{value,label}` option set. Legacy rows with no option snapshot regenerate with
  an explicit selected-only note; corrupt snapshots render an explicit unavailable
  state rather than silently substituting today's question definition.
- [OWNER DECISION] This phase does not upload generated review DOCX files to
  SharePoint. Dataverse remains authoritative. The existing combined export stays
  an on-demand download, and the individual document is a courtesy attachment.

## Release Boundary

The release is complete. Wave 25 is exact in Production, the six reviewed commits
were fast-forwarded to `main`, and deployment
`dpl_AjT5FeDh5wkdeFSoZWJsVDM5oBqs` reached Ready at 2026-09-03 09:07 PDT.
The pre-release evidence remains: 306/306 affected-workflow tests, all relevant
structural gates and self-tests, TypeScript, lint with 0 errors/76 existing
warnings, a production build, and both template bundle traces.

[VERIFIED via signed-in Production Workbench export] Request `1002903` exposed
the Word action for its submitted review and generated a valid 60,586-byte DOCX
named `reviews-1002903-20260903.docx`. ZIP integrity passed and the package title
and header read **Aggregated Proposal Reviews**. Focused Vercel logs recorded
three export requests with successful 2xx Dataverse dependencies; the bounded
post-deploy error-level scan returned no logs. No review data was altered and no
thank-you email was sent during verification, so the courtesy-send path remains
deployed/source/test/render verified rather than transport-smoked in Production.

## Following Priority

After this schema-first release is verified, return to Final Writeup persona
access proof and deliberate rollout in `docs/CURRENT_WORK_QUEUE.md`.

## Parked

- Review-DOCX storage/link replacement in SharePoint is not part of this release.
- One-click PDF remains a possible future conversion of the canonical DOCX.
- Automatic review-due reminder scheduling remains held.

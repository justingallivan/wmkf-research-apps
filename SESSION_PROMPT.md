# Session 671 Prompt: Resume roster migration from the saved checkpoint

## Session 670 Summary — Codex, November 9, 2026 Pacific

Owner requested stop and a docs-only handoff on main. Roster runtime work remains on
`codex/expertise-roster-foundation-2026-11-09` at `1aedcb25d`, pushed. Its last verified
foundation is `d2b467e84`; the later service/editor changes are explicitly unverified.
Do not promote the feature branch. Detailed resume boundary, settled mappings, test
limits and local-only evidence: `docs/plans/EXPERTISE_ROSTER_HANDOFF_2026-11-09.md`.

The complete preceding Request-narratives handoff remains retrievable with
`git show 7b7e483b0:SESSION_PROMPT.md`; its durable details are also on main in
`docs/plans/REQUEST_NARRATIVES_HANDOFF_2026-11-09.md`. Those owner decisions and
release boundaries remain in force. This session did not resume those changes.

### What Was Completed

- Roster plan/reviews, real read-only inventory, sandbox schema and synthetic
  identity/key/ETag/FK rollback rehearsal. No Production data or runtime cutover.
- Confirmed staff mapping and eligibility decisions, Amy staging, and TBD exclusion
  with preserved numeric history. Slot attendees correctly belong to parent sessions.
- Latest service/editor draft preserved in an explicitly marked WIP commit and pushed.
  No claim that this draft is tested, complete or ready for deployment.

### Commits

Verified foundation: `7512c0fd6`, `e4e39b494`, `ad7c4a511`, `d2b467e84`.
Unverified checkpoint: `1aedcb25d`. Earlier plan/review commits are listed in the
roster handoff. All are on the feature branch, not promoted by this docs landing.

## Next Items

### Verified Open

1. Review and test roster WIP before extending it. Build real import execution,
   then complete dependent runtime consumers and the editor. Evidence: checkpoint
   source and detailed roster handoff; importer remains planning-only.
2. Owner-reviewed minimal matching prompt contract and full isolated app rehearsal
   remain necessary before cutover. No expertise-content/scoring decision is needed
   to resume mechanics. See roster plan on feature branch.
3. Separate Request-narratives stream: external Power Automate initialization contract,
   J27 integration review, and approved staff save/readback remain open as recorded in
   its owning handoff. Recheck with that owner before acting; do not restart built code.

### Owner Decision Needed

- Roster Production release is not authorized. Private local exports/receipts need
  an approved secure transfer/retention location if continuing on another Mac.
- Request-narratives release timing and test Request/environment remain owner decisions.
- Inherited J27 decisions (unchanged): offramp justification location and status owner,
  retention of First Cut answers, fit-flag meaning, intake outputs/owners, staff queues,
  Chairs materials and calendar changes. Recheck Claude's current alignment log.

### Parked

SoCal separation; real J27 readiness readback after December 8; bulk edits, queues and
packet exports. Existing scope boundaries preserved, not newly authorized.

### Verify Before Acting

- Roster local-only data and container paths are in the detailed handoff. Git does not
  transfer them. No real data was imported into sandbox. Preserve all fixtures.
- J27 cycle page is already branch-built; current main build plan section 7 owns its
  status. Preview alias/settings are owner-controlled and were not probed here.
- Preserve main's untracked J27 development brief and concurrent worktree changes.
  This handoff was prepared in a separate docs worktree from current origin/main.
- Claim-evidence pilot report returned unavailable. No row was invented. No memory
  router edits occurred. Check current permissions and worktree state on resume.

### Do Not Reopen Without New Decision

- Roster: one profile/person, one category, optional Contact links, no new Contacts for
  privacy-sensitive Board members, separate lead eligibility, preserved expertise fields.
- Justin/Jean/John lead eligible; Beth off; Kevin inactive; Amy staged inactive. John
  reuses roster ID 1. TBD profile excluded but ID 35 preserves existing feedback.
- Request narrative fields already exist in Production; external flow initializes them,
  app edits them, and intentional human edits/clearing must not be overwritten.
- Inherited D7/D8: Offramped is Phase II status `682090001`; Workbench is Research-only.

## Concurrent Streams and Preservation

| Owner / stream | Recorded resume boundary / authority |
|---|---|
| Codex / Request narratives | `/private/tmp/wmkf-request-narratives`, `codex/request-narratives-2026-11-09`, `06e1ba6a4`; detailed handoff on main |
| Claude / J27 cycle page | `/Users/gallivan/Code/WMKF_Apps-claude-j27-read-model`, current branch `claude/j27-cycle-page`, observed tip `4038e8ace`; main's J27 cycle-page build plan section 7 |
| Codex / expertise roster | `/private/tmp/wmkf-codex-isolated-start-2026-11-09`, `codex/expertise-roster-foundation-2026-11-09`, pushed `1aedcb25d` (unverified WIP); main roster handoff is authoritative resume boundary |
| Codex / J27 Factory | `codex/j27-factory-scenarios`, recorded `9070030c7`; owning plan remains on that branch; no Factory runs performed here |
| Codex / J27 reports | `codex/j27-workbench-reports`, recorded `97f696faf`; original brief remains untracked in main checkout |
| Earlier streams | Full dated handoff at `a046f8a22:SESSION_PROMPT.md`; not newly audited or promoted |

## Testing and milestone determination

18 roster foundation tests and relevant gates passed at `d2b467e84`. Later WIP only
received parser checks on three JS files and `git diff --check`; run appropriate tests,
build/type/DAL/security gates and browser verification before readiness claims.

No DEVELOPMENT_LOG entry required: no new Production capability shipped in this
roster work. CLAUDE.md unchanged. This main landing contains documentation only.

# Session 670 Prompt: Connect Request narrative fields and review J27 integration

## Session 669 Summary — Codex, 2026-11-09 Pacific

This is a **docs-only handoff on main**. Runtime implementation remains on
`codex/request-narratives-2026-11-09` at `06e1ba6a4`, pushed and verified.
The prior complete handoff is retrievable with
`git show a046f8a22487a81666fb126bf4c81cf571020a6d:SESSION_PROMPT.md`.
Concurrent-session details below are dated resume boundaries, not authority to
change their checkouts, fixtures, deployment settings or branches.

### What Was Completed

1. **Two optional Request text fields implemented on the feature branch.**
   `lay_abstract` maps to `akoya_request.wmkf_layabstract` (Lay Abstract);
   `initial_assessment` maps to `wmkf_initialassessment` (Initial Assessment).
   Both are plain-text Memo columns with a 100,000-character limit. No in-app
   generation: Power Automate supplies the initial values. The new assessment
   text is separate from the governed Initial Assessment document and pointer.
2. **Production schema provisioned after explicit owner approval.**
   [VERIFIED via wave `36-request-narratives` apply and independent
   `scripts/probe-request-narrative-fields.js --target=prod --verify` on the
   feature branch] Both fields have exact names, labels, type, optional status,
   length and read/update capability. A zero-row runtime projection accepted
   both columns. No Request content was read or changed during verification.
3. **Explicit staff editing implemented and tested, not promoted.** Overview
   hosts one new card (three-line integration). GET/PATCH
   `/api/workbench/request-narratives` reads both fields and saves only changed
   keys. Writes require lead PD or linked superuser, enabled staff impersonation,
   trusted DAL context and concrete ETag; stale/concurrent edits fail without
   retry. Dirty drafts survive errors and navigation asks before discarding.
4. **Verification.** 33 focused tests plus 18 existing Overview regression tests
   passed; production build and affected gates passed. Full lint: zero errors,
   190 warnings. Independent review found tab-navigation draft loss; it was
   fixed and the reviewer verified the regression test. Feature worktree clean.
5. **Connor memo drafted in chat, not sent.** It names both production fields and
   the external flow's required one-time initialization / concurrency safeguards.
   Detailed evidence and rollout limits:
   `docs/plans/REQUEST_NARRATIVES_HANDOFF_2026-11-09.md`.

### Commits

Feature branch (both pushed):
- `7b5305a7c` — Add editable Request lay abstract and initial assessment fields.
- `06e1ba6a4` — Verify production Request narrative fields and record provisioning.

Milestone determination: no DEVELOPMENT_LOG entry required. This session
provisioned additive schema and built branch code; the end-to-end production
capability is not deployed. CLAUDE.md stays unchanged: feature inventory belongs
in the Atlas and handoff, not the root instructions.

## Next Items

### Verified Open

1. **Power Automate initialization contract.** The external flow is not in this
   repository and was not changed. Connor must verify durable once-per-Request
   initialization, concrete `If-Match`, refusal on conflict, and no refill after
   intentional human clearing. A blank field is not an initialization marker.
   Evidence: feature handoff's Power Automate owner contract and owner direction
   in this chat. Flow implementation/status must be checked with its owner.
2. **J27 integration and app promotion.** The Request text card is built on its
   own branch; the owner authorized only a small integration pending merge review
   with Claude's active J27 work. Evidence: branch `06e1ba6a4` and main's
   `docs/plans/J27_CYCLE_PAGE_BUILD_PLAN_2026-11-09.md` section 7. Review the
   Overview placement against that branch before deliberate runtime promotion.
3. **Approved staff save/readback rehearsal.** Mocked tests and live metadata
   verification do not prove an actual staff save. Choose an owner-approved
   test Request and environment, verify impersonation, then exercise initial
   fill, save/reload, clearing, stale form and external-flow retry behavior.
   Local sandbox URL is absent and local impersonation was disabled; no
   environment setting was changed.

### Owner Decision Needed

1. Runtime deployment timing and approved test Request/environment for the new
   fields. Schema provisioning approval did not authorize arbitrary record writes
   or feature promotion.
2. Inherited unresolved J27 decisions: where offramp justification lives; who
   sets Offramped; retention of the original First Cut answer; fit-flag meaning,
   remaining intake outputs/owners, staff queues, Chairs materials and calendar
   changes. These were recorded in the prior handoff and were not resolved by
   creating these two text fields. Recheck the active alignment log with Claude.

### Parked

Inherited scope boundaries (not reauthorized): Southern California as a separate
suite; real J27 readiness readback after December 8; bulk edits, queues and packet
exports. Re-open only with owner direction and current-plan verification.

### Verify Before Acting

1. **J27 cycle page is already branch-built.** Do not restart its design/build
   from the prior session prompt. Main commit `a046f8a22` records the built slices
   on `claude/j27-cycle-page`, including `4038e8ace`; that was the observed local
   tip at handoff preparation. Staff-flow audit and remaining details belong to
   Claude's current plan and should be rechecked there.
2. **Preview alias and branch-scoped environment settings.** The prior handoff
   records a sandbox-backed Preview and an owner-controlled restore. Current alias
   was not probed here. Do not restore, retire settings or deploy based on that
   inherited snapshot.
3. **Preserve dirty work.** Main checkout contains the unrelated untracked
   `docs/plans/J27_WORKBENCH_DEVELOPMENT_BRIEF_2026-11-06.md`; Claude's active J27
   checkout has a modified `package-lock.json`. Both were observed and untouched.
   Re-inventory before any future reuse or cleanup; no teardown is authorized.
4. **Existing test fixtures stay.** No fixture deletion or status change occurred
   or was authorized in this session. Historical cleanup ideas require live
   caller/ownership checks and a new decision.
5. **Claim-evidence pilot report unavailable.** The required current-session
   report returned unavailable; this Codex environment has no usable current
   report context. No observation row was invented or borrowed from another
   session. No memory-router edits or growth occurred in this session.

### Do Not Reopen Without New Decision

- Both new columns are already provisioned in production. Re-probe before any
  schema operation; do not recreate or backfill them automatically.
- External Power Automate owns initial generation; the app only reads/edits/saves.
- Preserve intentional staff edits and clearing; no automatic overwrite/refill.
- Inherited D7/D8: Offramped is Phase II status `682090001`; Workbench read model
  is Research-only. This session does not revise those decisions.

## Testing

Run in the feature worktree; these files are intentionally not on main:

```bash
npx jest tests/unit/request-narratives-service.test.js tests/unit/request-narratives-card.test.js tests/unit/request-narratives-route.test.js --runInBand
DATAVERSE_ALLOW_PROD_READS=yes node scripts/probe-request-narrative-fields.js --target=prod --verify
```

The metadata probe is read-only and does not return Request content. Full build,
lint and affected gates passed on the feature branch. Handoff changes on main are
documentation only; they do not deploy the new route or editor.

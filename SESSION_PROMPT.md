# Session 521 Prompt: Local document refactor complete; release decision pending

## Prior Session 519 Summary

Session 519 was short. It started on `main` in sync with origin, ran every `check:*` gate
(one red: `check:j27-register`, see below), explained the open applicant-materials
reminder-cron question to the owner, and then recorded the owner's decision to retire that
cron. No code behaviour changed.

### What Was Completed

1. **Applicant-materials reminder cron retired (owner decision 2026-09-17), commit `28d719d9`.**
   The staff member who monitors whether materials arrive will do that follow-up manually,
   so `/api/cron/site-visit-materials-reminders` will not be scheduled. The route and
   `lib/services/site-visit-materials/reminder-sweep.js` stay in the tree, callable with
   `CRON_SECRET`, absent from `vercel.json`. Reconciled restatements: plan
   `docs/APPLICANT_ADDITIONAL_MATERIALS_PLAN.md` (§16.6 item 1 decided, M5 follow-up closed,
   Slice 3 list), the route header comment, `docs/atlas/postgres-infra-tables.md`, the
   closed-work archive line, and memory leaf `project-ops-meeting-2026-09-16-agenda`
   (now `status: closed`, all six items decided; its router line removed because closed
   leaves route only via the archive). Gates run on the touched surfaces: memory-router,
   api-routes, atlas, doc-currency, fact-consistency, canonical-pointers, doc-symbol-refs,
   build-claim-freshness, harness-framing, agent-wiki, reviewer-reminder-hold, types; the
   cron route unit test passes (3/3).
2. **Start-of-session gate sweep.** Every other `check:*` gate and self-test green,
   `check:types` green, `check:memory-health` at the expected 7 advisory flags, and the
   memory router did NOT print the 8 KiB audit notice (the S518 diet held).

### Commits (main)
- `28d719d9` - docs: retire the applicant-materials reminder cron (owner decision 2026-09-17)

## Session 520 Summary

1. **J27 register citation repair.** The four rows in
   `docs/J27_TRANSITION_REGISTER.md` (J27-053 line 97, J27-057 line 101, J27-062 line 111,
   J27-064 line 113) now bind to exact excerpts in
   `.claude-memory/project-reviewer-apps-redesign-history.md` (lines 369, 303, 319, and
   329 respectively). J27-062 retains its separate `project-grant-phasing-evolution.md`
   plan fragment; J27-064 retains the current owner decision in the register disposition
   while using the historical allowlist-removal sentence as its source excerpt. The gate
   and self-test pass: 61 ok, 0 stale, 6 unverifiable, 11 closed. The six unverifiable
   rows (J27-034, -061, -067, -075, -076, -077) are advisory and pre-existing.

2. **Governed document lifecycle refactor — local execution authorized 2026-09-18.** The owner requested
   a staged plan, with fresh-context assumption reviews, for the largest defensible
   remaining refactor. The plan is
   `docs/plans/GOVERNED_DOCUMENT_LIFECYCLE_DECOMPOSITION_PLAN_2026-09-17.md`.
   It covers four document service coordinators, preserves separate state machines
   and public facades, and specifies prerequisite tests, ordered symbol/file moves,
   stage gates, review receipts and rollback. Planning was committed as `02c41a08`.
   The owner subsequently authorized local execution: Luna implements and builds,
   Sol reviews, and the orchestrator performs final acceptance, taking over stalled
   correction loops. Branch: `codex/document-lifecycle-decomposition`. Stage 0
   accepted in `7a2ed504`: 955 suites / 14,075 tests, lint/types/canonical build and
   required gates passed; Sol approved and root verified the real-route tests.
   Stage 1 accepted in `8a7060b9` after prerequisite commit `c58237c4`: neutral
   hash leaf, ten consumer imports, unchanged public hash API; 955 suites / 14,076
   tests and all required checks passed. Stage 2 accepted in `e4c10355` after test
   prerequisite `de875d68`: IA model/read modules; fresh Sol review and root checks
   passed, 955 suites / 14,078 tests plus all required checks. Stage 3 accepted in
   `2f7668b6` after test prerequisite `fbede538`: IA lineage/upload-recovery modules;
   fresh Sol review and root checks passed with the same full test count and all
   required checks. Stage 4 accepted in `569ab797`: Pre-Site model/defaults/read/
   lineage/recovery, with populated/historical fixtures verified on both old and new
   code; fresh Sol and root approval, 955 suites / 14,085 tests and required checks.
   Stage 5a accepted in `d673afc6`: distribution model/composition/defaults/context,
   unchanged public facade and writer; fresh Sol and root approval, 957 suites /
   14,100 tests and required checks. Calendar-send prerequisites passed on old/new code.
   Stage 5b accepted in `555a7bda`: retained snapshot module and atomic writer-registry
   move; fresh Sol/root approval, 957 suites / 14,101 tests and required checks.
   Stage 6 accepted in `c76703eb`: prepare/send/history/email recovery separated,
   unchanged facade exports and sequencing; fresh Sol/root approval, 957 suites /
   14,113 tests and required checks. Stage 7 accepted in `a9d4b0e8`: Final model/
   defaults/state/claims separated, both commands and five public names preserved;
   fresh Sol/root approval, 957 suites / 14,121 tests and required checks. Stage 8
   accepted in `588fd382` (boundary prerequisites) and `7ed52a45` (closure): AST
   import/cycle/export/writer enforcement, source headers and ownership docs; fresh
   Sol/root approval, 958 suites / 14,151 tests and required checks. All stages 0–8
   are complete locally; no migration stage remains to build. Receipts:
   `docs/plans/GOVERNED_DOCUMENT_LIFECYCLE_EXECUTION_2026-09-18.md`. No push, deployment or live data
   writes are authorized. See the plan's review record and evidence limits before acting.

3. **Post-review hardening (2026-09-18).** Claude reviewed `5f069b32` as READY
   with three low findings. Removed four unused imports, corrected the facade/leaf
   export receipt wording, and extended boundary mutation tests for cross-domain
   imports, adapter aliases, optional/call/apply writes and hash-consumer ownership.
   [VERIFIED via local commands] Core smoke: 18 suites / 478 tests; auth routes:
   9 suites / 64 tests; full Jest: 958 suites / 14,174 tests. Lint/types pass.
   Operator smoke stages, fixtures, evidence and stop criteria are in
   `docs/plans/GOVERNED_DOCUMENT_LIFECYCLE_SMOKE_TESTS_2026-09-18.md`.
   Fresh Sol acceptance and root final review passed after one bounded correction
   round. A subsequent source-mode read-only smoke on ZZTEST-03 passed signed-in
   IA/version/Pre-Site/history/Final reads and signed-out redirects; S1 is partial.
   The subsequent read-only S1 subset and incomplete S2 rehearsal are recorded separately; bounded service reconciliation completed the restore metadata. The later guarded Pre-Site reopen and return-to-Review succeeded; the exact retry/stale/fault matrix remains unrun, while S3 passed separately and S4 was NOT RUN at that earlier run. No fresh canonical build for the earlier hardening import/test/docs follow-up; prior build evidence remains historical. The current restore fix has 4 suites / 42 tests plus a successful canonical build recorded in the execution receipt. No push/deploy authorized.

   A separately owner-authorized controlled rehearsal on ZZTEST-03 was stopped after two IA failures. Generation returned HTTP 500 `claude_output_truncated` (run `7d8b647c-abb3-f111-aaac-000d3a361c1f`) and created one Failed row `ea6e4768-abb3-f111-aaac-6045bd04539e`; request state, 24 pre-existing Dataverse Request Document rows and 13 distribution attempts were unchanged; the SharePoint restore effect is recorded separately. Restore selected version 1.0 from current 2.0; Graph produced stable current 3.0 with historical 1.0/2.0 retained and equal governed hashes, but the API returned `initial_assessment_restore_bytes_mismatch` before registry metadata persistence. Readback is `/tmp/wmkf-restore-readback.json`; raw package differences were limited to custom XML/properties/trash parts. No PSV, distribution prepare/send, email, Final or leadership action ran. The initial browser restore failure is historical. A bounded PATCH-only service recovery then returned `restored:false`, `reconciled:true` with one registry update and zero Graph restores; independent readback confirmed the existing IA row at version 3.0, preserved history and the same governed hash. The recovery process exited 0. This is not a global database audit, and the browser restore was not rerun; S2 remains incomplete and S3–S4 were NOT RUN at that earlier run.

   Production follow-up attributed to the Claude handoff: PR #314 merge `0b240f0a` deployed the IA thinking-budget fix, and the signed-in production rerun on request 1003222 reported PASS at 23:38Z. Run `7770d508-bab3-f111-aaac-7ced8d3c3a59` ended `end_turn` with 1,065 output tokens, `thinkingTokens=0`, and `maxTokens=12000`; Ready row `7d00fffd-b9b3-f111-aaac-000d3a361c1f` became the current IA pointer, superseding `a6876ad6-3b94-f111-8075-70a8a59cded0`, and the exact retry reused the row without a new run. Root independently verified the sanitized pointer/reconciliation readbacks: 28 Request Document rows, one new Ready row, only the prior IA lifecycle/modified fields changed among 27 prior rows, current PSV `205da1cd-b7b3-f111-aaac-6045bd04539e` unchanged in Review, Final null, and all 14 attempts unchanged. Provider tokens, stop reason and exact retry remain Claude-attributed evidence; the isolated candidate now integrates prompt v2 and has passed local validation; it has not been live-rerun.

   Follow-up smoke continuation on isolated candidate `f45581ed`: the 269-route build passed; Board snapshot returned row `dc7558c4-b2b3-f111-aaac-7ced8d3c3a59` for IA artifact `a6876ad6-3b94-f111-8075-70a8a59cded0` at v3.0 with governed hash `gdc1:yGi7ISeqZspD0PwIecM9bbGPZQhn7hJpEV_k6Qgv4Yk` and distinct item `01G4GVMS5XTETQIS3JPNEIXAKRDZPRBY35`. The earlier pre-override distribution prepare returned 503 `distribution_briefing_required`, and the earlier guarded reopen returned 503 because `GUARDED_REOPEN_SCHEMA_READY` was unset; those readbacks were unchanged.

   On accepted code `cbad8a8d`, migration 038 was verified already applied; process-only briefing readiness, `DELIBERATION_BRIEFING_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`, and impersonation configuration enabled the approved S3 rehearsal while local `NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000` remained the staff-auth origin. Prepare passed, the first send failed closed before claim, and the same preview then returned `Sent for delivery`; Dynamics later reached status 3 with `senton` (initial status 6), the user confirmed inbox receipt on 2026-09-18; this does not infer that the user clicked the public briefing link. Request and 26 Request Document rows were unchanged; 13 prior attempts remained unchanged and total attempts became 14. S3 approved happy-path email smoke passed and inbox receipt was user-confirmed. The later PSV reopen and return-to-Review happy path passed; the exact retry/stale/fault matrix remains unrun. No AI regeneration ran. S4 Final and leadership happy paths subsequently passed on the same PSV fixture; the remaining fault matrix and wrong-app account case remain unrun/mock-only.

   S4 controlled production smoke from local candidate `aff3049d` on the approved ZZTEST-03 request passed after the PSV successor was in Review. Final row `473c9160-c0b3-f111-aaac-000d3a361c1f` was created on the same SharePoint item, group review started at `2026-09-19T00:23:51Z`, leadership at `2026-09-19T00:24:37Z`, and both transitions used the session-derived actor `29b0de0d-4ff7-ee11-a1fd-000d3a3621c7`. Exact start and leadership retries returned HTTP 200 with `reused:true` and equal DTOs. Independent reconciliation showed 28→29 Request Document rows, only the prior source lifecycle/modified fields changed plus the four expected Final leadership fields, and all 14 distribution attempts unchanged; no AI, email or SharePoint upload/copy calls were observed in the bounded dependency capture, and no schema action ran. Three Dataverse writes first rejected impersonation and then succeeded through the supported service-principal fallback; this does not claim native CreatedBy impersonation. Sanitized evidence is in `/tmp/wmkf-final-smoke-{before,group,leadership,reconciliation,graph-before,graph-after,unauth,inventory,dependency-summary}.json` and the HTTP/proxy captures. The UI showed leadership after reload, and five signed-out route checks returned 307. Final fault cases and the wrong-app account case remain unrun/mock-only.

Current fixture: IA `7d00fffd` remains unchanged; PSV `205da1cd` is now Final; current Final `473c9160` is in leadership review. Both rehearsal servers are stopped. The owner chose mock-only coverage for wrong-app access and review-bundle rebuild. Sol accepted the sanitized S4 evidence and root completed final review.

## Next Items

**Local refactor release boundary:** all stages are committed on
`codex/document-lifecycle-decomposition`; do not push, merge or deploy without a
new release instruction. UI behavior is intended to remain unchanged. No production
milestone entry was required because the branch has not shipped. The optional
claim-evidence report could not read its local state; no observation was inferred.
The unrelated carryovers below retain their prior evidence and need fresh checks
before any live work; this refactor did not re-probe production.


### Verified Open

1. **Bundle rebuild after a new review** was never smoked in Production (unchanged from
   S517). Evidence: `docs/plans/PRE_RESEARCH_PRESENTATION_BRIEF_PLAN_2026-09-16.md` §12 step
   table ("NOT RUN — no third review submitted"). Needs a third ZZTEST-03 reviewer submission
   via the portal, then "Download all reviews (PDF)" on the briefing page should rebuild.
2. **Memory deep-audit remainder.** Evidence: `docs/audits/memory-routine-audit-2026-09-17.md`
   "Unknowns". Shrink `project-site-visit-materials-planning-handoff` (7.6 KB; its line 42
   "Open (plan §12)" list still names "reminder cadence", now decided). The other four
   oversize-routed leaves are accepted. `check:memory-health` is advisory and prints 7 flags:
   5 oversize-routed plus 2 accepted shadow-atlas false positives.

### Owner Decision Needed

1. **Whether to delete the unscheduled reminder-cron code.** Evidence: commit `28d719d9`
   kept `pages/api/cron/site-visit-materials-reminders.js`, `reminder-sweep.js`, and
   `tests/unit/site-visit-materials-reminders-cron.test.js`; the owner was told this is a
   separate decision and did not ask for removal. If asked: destructive carryover, so grep
   live callers first, and expect edits to `docs/API_ROUTE_SECURITY_MATRIX.md` (line 169),
   the Atlas, plan §16.3, and `check:api-routes`.
2. **Plan §11 "Open for owner" (PR #312):** unconvertible review fails Share closed vs a
   placeholder page; Unicode reviewer names need `@pdf-lib/fontkit` + a bundled TTF;
   separator-page content; the three bundle bounds as code literals (memory
   `feedback-mutable-parameters-not-in-code`). Unchanged from S517.
3. **Plan §10.4 residual (PR #311)** and **plan §12 accepted residual (Codex round 3)**:
   unchanged from S517.
4. **Managed private-repository migration gates** (unchanged from S514). Evidence:
   `docs/MANAGED_PRIVATE_GITHUB_REPOSITORY_MIGRATION_PLAN.md`.
5. **Memory-drift report refresh.** `check:memory-drift` evaluates a committed report it
   flags as stale; `npm run refresh:memory-drift` is an authorized live refresh
   (production reads) and was not run.

### Parked

1. Plan §8 (vi) panel defaults-seed case and the To-field caret splice (plan §12 note 1);
   plan §8 remaining items; plan §12 note 3 (Administration "Guarded reopen attempts"
   shows Pre-Site only). Unchanged from S517.
2. Five protected historical branches; reviewer-institution Phase 3 flags (unchanged).
3. Router diet landing point (6.9 KiB / 51 leaves after S519 removed one line) is above
   the §10 target (~6 KiB / ~45); going further needs a norms hub page, a design choice.

### Verify Before Acting

1. ZZTEST-03 residue: the prior regenerated brief remains locked and previewed (not sent) as the
   current share; the 9:20 AM sent row and shared briefing link remain. The 2026-09-18
   controlled rehearsal stopped after the IA generation/restore failures recorded above;
   review the Failed row and keep the bounded restore reconciliation evidence with any future smoke.
2. The #311/#312 conflict resolution (`dcc9c796`) and the fixture fix (`8f8cfc1b`) are
   test-verified but were never Codex-reviewed.
3. Worktree `../WMKF_Apps-codex` was left clean on `codex/parked` at `6ed14ae9` by S518;
   S519 did not touch it. Confirm before delegating to Codex.

### Do Not Reopen Without New Decision

1. **Applicant-materials reminder cron is retired** (owner, 2026-09-17). Staff monitor
   arrivals manually. Do not add `/api/cron/site-visit-materials-reminders` to
   `vercel.json`. Recorded in plan §16.6 item 1 and the closed memory leaf.
2. **Cycle Dossier drain cadence is `*/5 * * * *`** (owner, 2026-09-16). Recorded in
   `docs/CYCLE_DOSSIER_PILOT_DESIGN.md`. Do not reopen Vercel Workflow or alternatives.
3. Ops-meeting items 2–6 (plan §16.6). Item 3's guard exists since S507 `90641978`.
4. Owner decisions B1–B14 in the Pre-RP Brief plan; Word snapshot identity is the
   governed content hash; confirmed sends render only **Sent for delivery.**

# Session 520 Prompt: Pre-RP Brief bundle smoke and remaining documentation follow-ups

## Session 519 Summary

Session 519 was short. It started on `main` in sync with origin, ran every `check:*` gate
(one red: `check:j27-register`, see below), explained the open applicant-materials
reminder-cron question to the owner, and then recorded the owner's decision to retire that
cron. No code behaviour changed.

### What Was Completed

1. **Applicant-materials reminder cron retired (owner decision 2026-09-17), commit `28d719d9`.**
   The staff member who monitors whether materials arrive will do that follow-up manually,
   so `/api/cron/site-visit-materials-reminders` will not be scheduled. The route and
   `lib/services/site-visit-materials/reminder-sweep.js` stay in the tree, callable with
   `CRON_SECRET`, absent from `vercel.json`. Reconciled restatements: plan
   `docs/APPLICANT_ADDITIONAL_MATERIALS_PLAN.md` (§16.6 item 1 decided, M5 follow-up closed,
   Slice 3 list), the route header comment, `docs/atlas/postgres-infra-tables.md`, the
   closed-work archive line, and memory leaf `project-ops-meeting-2026-09-16-agenda`
   (now `status: closed`, all six items decided; its router line removed because closed
   leaves route only via the archive). Gates run on the touched surfaces: memory-router,
   api-routes, atlas, doc-currency, fact-consistency, canonical-pointers, doc-symbol-refs,
   build-claim-freshness, harness-framing, agent-wiki, reviewer-reminder-hold, types; the
   cron route unit test passes (3/3).
2. **Start-of-session gate sweep.** Every other `check:*` gate and self-test green,
   `check:types` green, `check:memory-health` at the expected 7 advisory flags, and the
   memory router did NOT print the 8 KiB audit notice (the S518 diet held).

### Commits (main)
- `28d719d9` - docs: retire the applicant-materials reminder cron (owner decision 2026-09-17)

## Completed in Session 520

1. **J27 register citation repair.** The four rows in
   `docs/J27_TRANSITION_REGISTER.md` (J27-053 line 97, J27-057 line 101, J27-062 line 111,
   J27-064 line 113) now bind to exact excerpts in
   `.claude-memory/project-reviewer-apps-redesign-history.md` (lines 369, 303, 319, and
   329 respectively). J27-062 retains its separate `project-grant-phasing-evolution.md`
   plan fragment; J27-064 retains the current owner decision in the register disposition
   while using the historical allowlist-removal sentence as its source excerpt. The gate
   and self-test pass: 61 ok, 0 stale, 6 unverifiable, 11 closed. The six unverifiable
   rows (J27-034, -061, -067, -075, -076, -077) are advisory and pre-existing.

2. **Governed document lifecycle refactor — local execution authorized 2026-09-18.** The owner requested
   a staged plan, with fresh-context assumption reviews, for the largest defensible
   remaining refactor. The plan is
   `docs/plans/GOVERNED_DOCUMENT_LIFECYCLE_DECOMPOSITION_PLAN_2026-09-17.md`.
   It covers four document service coordinators, preserves separate state machines
   and public facades, and specifies prerequisite tests, ordered symbol/file moves,
   stage gates, review receipts and rollback. Planning was committed as `02c41a08`.
   The owner subsequently authorized local execution: Luna implements and builds,
   Sol reviews, and the orchestrator performs final acceptance, taking over stalled
   correction loops. Branch: `codex/document-lifecycle-decomposition`. Stage 0
   accepted in `7a2ed504`: 955 suites / 14,075 tests, lint/types/canonical build and
   required gates passed; Sol approved and root verified the real-route tests.
   Stage 1 accepted in `8a7060b9` after prerequisite commit `c58237c4`: neutral
   hash leaf, ten consumer imports, unchanged public hash API; 955 suites / 14,076
   tests and all required checks passed. Stage 2 accepted in `e4c10355` after test
   prerequisite `de875d68`: IA model/read modules; fresh Sol review and root checks
   passed, 955 suites / 14,078 tests plus all required checks. Stage 3 accepted in
   `2f7668b6` after test prerequisite `fbede538`: IA lineage/upload-recovery modules;
   fresh Sol review and root checks passed with the same full test count and all
   required checks. Next: Stage 4 Pre-Site model/read/lineage/recovery. Receipts:
   `docs/plans/GOVERNED_DOCUMENT_LIFECYCLE_EXECUTION_2026-09-18.md`. No push, deployment or live data
   writes are authorized. See the plan's review record and evidence limits before acting.

## Next Items

### Verified Open

1. **Bundle rebuild after a new review** was never smoked in Production (unchanged from
   S517). Evidence: `docs/plans/PRE_RESEARCH_PRESENTATION_BRIEF_PLAN_2026-09-16.md` §12 step
   table ("NOT RUN — no third review submitted"). Needs a third ZZTEST-03 reviewer submission
   via the portal, then "Download all reviews (PDF)" on the briefing page should rebuild.
2. **Memory deep-audit remainder.** Evidence: `docs/audits/memory-routine-audit-2026-09-17.md`
   "Unknowns". Shrink `project-site-visit-materials-planning-handoff` (7.6 KB; its line 42
   "Open (plan §12)" list still names "reminder cadence", now decided). The other four
   oversize-routed leaves are accepted. `check:memory-health` is advisory and prints 7 flags:
   5 oversize-routed plus 2 accepted shadow-atlas false positives.

### Owner Decision Needed

1. **Whether to delete the unscheduled reminder-cron code.** Evidence: commit `28d719d9`
   kept `pages/api/cron/site-visit-materials-reminders.js`, `reminder-sweep.js`, and
   `tests/unit/site-visit-materials-reminders-cron.test.js`; the owner was told this is a
   separate decision and did not ask for removal. If asked: destructive carryover, so grep
   live callers first, and expect edits to `docs/API_ROUTE_SECURITY_MATRIX.md` (line 169),
   the Atlas, plan §16.3, and `check:api-routes`.
2. **Plan §11 "Open for owner" (PR #312):** unconvertible review fails Share closed vs a
   placeholder page; Unicode reviewer names need `@pdf-lib/fontkit` + a bundled TTF;
   separator-page content; the three bundle bounds as code literals (memory
   `feedback-mutable-parameters-not-in-code`). Unchanged from S517.
3. **Plan §10.4 residual (PR #311)** and **plan §12 accepted residual (Codex round 3)**:
   unchanged from S517.
4. **Managed private-repository migration gates** (unchanged from S514). Evidence:
   `docs/MANAGED_PRIVATE_GITHUB_REPOSITORY_MIGRATION_PLAN.md`.
5. **Memory-drift report refresh.** `check:memory-drift` evaluates a committed report it
   flags as stale; `npm run refresh:memory-drift` is an authorized live refresh
   (production reads) and was not run.

### Parked

1. Plan §8 (vi) panel defaults-seed case and the To-field caret splice (plan §12 note 1);
   plan §8 remaining items; plan §12 note 3 (Administration "Guarded reopen attempts"
   shows Pre-Site only). Unchanged from S517.
2. Five protected historical branches; reviewer-institution Phase 3 flags (unchanged).
3. Router diet landing point (6.9 KiB / 51 leaves after S519 removed one line) is above
   the §10 target (~6 KiB / ~45); going further needs a norms hub page, a design choice.

### Verify Before Acting

1. ZZTEST-03 residue: the regenerated brief is locked and previewed (not sent) as the
   current share; the 9:20 AM sent row and shared briefing link remain; abstract restored
   by the owner. A future smoke should start from this state.
2. The #311/#312 conflict resolution (`dcc9c796`) and the fixture fix (`8f8cfc1b`) are
   test-verified but were never Codex-reviewed.
3. Worktree `../WMKF_Apps-codex` was left clean on `codex/parked` at `6ed14ae9` by S518;
   S519 did not touch it. Confirm before delegating to Codex.

### Do Not Reopen Without New Decision

1. **Applicant-materials reminder cron is retired** (owner, 2026-09-17). Staff monitor
   arrivals manually. Do not add `/api/cron/site-visit-materials-reminders` to
   `vercel.json`. Recorded in plan §16.6 item 1 and the closed memory leaf.
2. **Cycle Dossier drain cadence is `*/5 * * * *`** (owner, 2026-09-16). Recorded in
   `docs/CYCLE_DOSSIER_PILOT_DESIGN.md`. Do not reopen Vercel Workflow or alternatives.
3. Ops-meeting items 2–6 (plan §16.6). Item 3's guard exists since S507 `90641978`.
4. Owner decisions B1–B14 in the Pre-RP Brief plan; Word snapshot identity is the
   governed content hash; confirmed sends render only **Sent for delivery.**

## Testing

```bash
npm run check:j27-register           # 61 ok / 0 stale / 6 unverifiable / 11 closed
npm test -- --runInBand --silent
npm run lint
npm run check:memory-router && npm run check:memory-router:self-test
npm run check:memory-health          # advisory; expect 7 flags (5 oversize-routed, 2 accepted shadow-atlas)
```

Session 519: all `check:*` gates green at start except `check:j27-register` (pre-existing,
caused by the S518 leaf split); touched-surface gates green at the one commit.
`report:claim-evidence-pilot -- --current` recorded no eligible plan/design edit; no
observation row added.
